<!-- # -Advantages of Vue.js

## Context

We want to use a CSS framework to create web application.

   * We want user experience to be fast and reliable, on all popular browsers and screen sizes.

   * We want rapid iteration on design, layout

   * We want a framework that have comprehensive set of tools and receives frequent updates.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt the Vue front-end JavaScript library based on the following factors:

   1. Lightweight: Vue is a lightweight library that offers functionality similar to that of React and Angular but with a smaller code footprint.

   2. Easy to learn: Vue has a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to learn and use.

   3. Flexibility: Vue is a flexible library that works well with other libraries or frameworks to provide different functionalities.

   4. Performance: Vue provides excellent performance with fast rendering and minimal overhead.

   5. Strong community: Vue has a growing and strong community that offers support and resources to the users.

## Rationale

Choosing to use Vue.js for web development can be attributed to several factors that make it a popular and effective choice.

   * Simple Syntax and Learning Curve: Vue.js has a clear and simple syntax, making it approachable for developers of varying skill levels. The gentle learning curve allows for quick adoption, even for those new to frontend development. 

   * Component-Based Architecture: Vue.js follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable and modular components. This approach enhances code maintainability, reusability, and facilitates collaboration within development teams.

   * Flexibility and Versatility: Vue.js offers flexibility in terms of usage. You can employ it to manage a specific part of your project or build an entire Single Page Application (SPA). This flexibility makes it suitable for various project sizes and requirements.

## Consequences

The decision to use Vue as the primary front-end JavaScript library will have the following consequences:

**Pro**
   * Development and maintenance will be faster and easier because of the simplicity and flexibility of Vue.
   
   * Team members who are new to Vue can easily learn and use it because of its simple and intuitive API.

**Cons**
   * Vue.js, while growing rapidly, has a smaller ecosystem compared to more established frameworks like React or Angular.

   * For very large and complex enterprise-level projects, Vue.js might have limited resources and support compared to other frameworks.

## Sample code

This simple example demonstrates how Vue.js allows you to create reusable components with clear data bindings and a straightforward syntax. It aligns with the decision to use Vue.js for its simplicity, flexibility, and component-based architecture.
```html
    <!-- index.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <body>
        <div id="app">
            <user-profile></user-profile>
        </div>

        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2"></script>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
```
```javascript
    Vue.component('user-profile', {
        data() {
            return {
                user: {
                    name: 'John Doe',
                    age: 25,
                    profession: 'Web Developer'
                }
            };
        },
        template: `
            <div>
                <h1>{{ user.name }}</h1>
                <p>Age: {{ user.age }}</p>
                <p>Profession: {{ user.profession }}</p>
            </div>
        `
    });

    new Vue({
        el: '#app'
    });
